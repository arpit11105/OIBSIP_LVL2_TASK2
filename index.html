                    <strong>
                    Subhas Chandra Bose, byname Netaji (Hindi: “Respected Leader”), 
                    (born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India—died 
                    August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan?), Indian revolutionary prominent in 
                    the independence movement against British rule of India. He also led an 
                    Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers during World 
                    War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and 
                    at other times an adversary. Bose was known in particular for his militant 
                    approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.

                    <h2>Early life and political activity</h2>
                <p>
                    The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at Presidency College, 
                    Calcutta (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, and 
                    the Scottish Churches College (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his parents to 
                    the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 
                    he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist 
                    turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India. Throughout his career, 
                    especially in its early stages, he was supported financially and emotionally by an elder 
                    brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889–1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian National Congress 
                    (also known as the Congress Party) politician.
                    Bose joined the noncooperation movement started by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who had made the 
                    Indian National Congress a powerful nonviolent organization. Bose was advised by Gandhi 
                    to work under Chitta Ranjan Das, a politician in Bengal. There Bose became a youth educator, 
                    journalist, and commandant of the Bengal Congress volunteers. His activities led to his 
                    imprisonment in December 1921. In 1924 he was appointed chief executive officer of the 
                    alcutta Municipal Corporation, with Das as mayor. Bose was soon after deported to Burma 
                    (Myanmar) because he was suspected of connections with secret revolutionary movements. 
                    Released in 1927, he returned to find Bengal Congress affairs in disarray after the death 
                    of Das, and Bose was elected president of the Bengal Congress. Shortly thereafter he and 
                    Jawaharlal Nehru became the two general secretaries of the Indian National Congress. 
                    Together they represented the more militant, left-wing faction of the party against the 
                    more compromising, right-wing Gandhian faction.

                    Island, formerly Ross Island and many other institutions in India are named after 
                    him. On 23 August 2007, Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzō Abe visited the Subhas Chandra Bose 
                    memorial hall in Kolkata. Abe said to Bose's family "The Japanese are deeply moved 
                    by Bose's strong will to have led the Indian independence movement from British rule. Netaji 
                    is a much respected name in Japan."
